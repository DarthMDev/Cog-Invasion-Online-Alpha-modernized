Collect jellybean barrels the cogs have stolen and sneak out with them.
The more barrels you sneak out with, the bigger the prize.
Takes place in Sellbot Factory.
Cog Guards guard corners and hallways.
You weld a Toon Battle gun.
The guards can hear your footsteps so crouch to be unheard.
Your suspicion points go up if a guard spots you or if you shoot your gun.
You can use your gun to defeat cog guards.
If your suspicion points get too high the guards will start searching the area for you.
Hiding away in corners or being unheard for a long time lowers suspicion points and the guards stop searching.
If you are spotted, the guards will start chasing you.
If the chase lasts for long enough, the guard will call in more guards OR if another guard sees you being chased, they will join in.
If the guard gets too close to you, you will surrender and lose and get no prize.
The factory foreman guards the exit to win.
The factory foreman has 4x speed.
The factory foreman is far away from the other guards, so if you shoot at him, the other guards can't hear and come to help.
